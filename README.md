# Random Beer App

Simple App to get random Beer. 

**Improviments needed**:
- Fetch image on home page. 
I am using react hooks to fetch data from API and react doesn't allow combine two hooks in the same component (useBeerData and useRandomBeerData) to fetch data and throws and error saying that I am using too many hooks. This can be dicussed in more details if needed. In the meanwhile, I will try to find a better solution to fix this issue.

Possible solutions:
- Don't use hooks to fetch data
- Create a separated method to get image
